Bond is an application that helps remind users to keep in touch with others, thus establishing the bonds between people and enhacing personal relationships. This app was originally created for Android, and has so far contained several features:
- Recording and saving detailed information of a contact (e.g. name, phone number, birthday, hobbies, first impression, etc.)
- Setting up reminders that notify user of the next time to connect with someone
- Viewing upcoming schedule in a calendar overview
- Providing ideas and templates for users' conversation (e.g. greetings, wishes, conversation starters, self-introductions, follow-up emails, etc.)

In the future, an iOS version for this app will be created. Additional features will also be implemented, such as:
- In-app text messaging and calling
- Collecting logs of conversations between the user and the contacts from different platforms (e.g. text messages, Facebook Messenger, Gmail)
- Collecting information of the contacts on social networking sites and other online sources
- Using this information to construct suggestions for conversations, emails and messages
- Improving available templates and generate messages that are personally customized to each contact
